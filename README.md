# Baseball Stat Caculator
### *by Sean Kim*

## *Proposal*

My project is a simple application that calculates stats of baseball players. Calculating stats 
is not difficult, but it takes a long time to calculate each players' stats one at a time. This application will
take in basic stats such as Hits, AB(at bat) Runs, RBI as inputs and calculate OBP, SLG, OPS. For pitchers 
inputs will be different and will calculate necessary stats for pitchers respectively. 
It will also add players to data to produce tables according to their stats.
This application would be particularly useful for people who are calculating
stats for little league baseball or scouters who look at amateur players as these players do not have
well-designed stat system as the professional players.

Ever since I was a little kid, I have been a huge fan of baseball
and even to this day, I try to allocate my time to watch big games 
and post-season games as it is one of hobbies. This project is particularly interesting to me
as I would be able to program that could be actually applied in baseball world. This is
the primary reason I chose my project to be baseball stat calculator as I can have fun and gain
programming knowledge by incorporating baseball and coding. 
## *User Story*

- As a user I want to create Pitchers and Batters and put them into List of Pitchers and Batters list
- As a user I want to be able to see all the players in the list
- As a user I want to be able to see overall stats of a player I created
- As a user I want to be able to see tables of list of players according to a particular stat
- As a user I want to be able to remove a player from list
- As a user I want to be able to edit players already existing
- As a user I want to be able to store my entries to a file
- As a user I want to retrieve players I entered from a file.

## Phase 4: Task 3
The UML diagram represents the overall structure of my project. 
If I was given more time to improve my project I would try to combine Pitchers and Batters
into one Class just as Player which would reduce Json Reader and Writer as well. This design would
look more neat and concise.
